# Reconciler: make the R2 object every Machine BOOTS FROM converge on the
# customer.yaml main actually carries (ss #2305).
#
# WHY. This is the R2 twin of ci-reconcile-customer-configs.sh (#2292), and the
# gap is the same one: ci-publish-customer-configs.sh is a TRIGGER, not a
# reconciler. It diffs one push range (`github.event.before..github.sha`,
# deploy.yml:202-203) and publishes whatever changed inside it. A range that is
# never processed — a failed deploy job, a skipped run, a force-push, the ~07-31
# history rewrite — is never revisited, because no LATER push's range contains
# it. Nothing compared R2 against git on any schedule.
#
# The stakes are the mirror image of #2292 and worse. A stale D1 row means the
# PORTAL shows the wrong posture. A stale R2 object means the SEAT ENFORCES the
# wrong one: entrypoint.sh re-fetches this object every boot, and a Machine on a
# fresh volume has nothing else to boot from.
#
# WHY IT COULD NOT SHARE CODE WITH THE D1 RECONCILER. Different comparison
# primitive. The D1 row carries a stamped `git_sha`, so provenance is comparable.
# The R2 object is the authored file VERBATIM — stamping provenance into it
# would make R2 diverge from git, which is exactly what #1898 forbids — so the
# only available comparison is BYTE IDENTITY between the object and what git
# carries at HEAD. Byte comparison is the whole check; there is no stamp to
# orphan. (The seats are enumerated from HEAD's TREE and the bytes are read off
# the checkout, with a clean-tree guard below making those the same thing.)
#
# ONE SIGNAL:
#
#   DRIFT  — the object's bytes are not the blob's bytes. Re-published from the
#            blob, then proven by reading the object back (the publisher's own
#            proof). Reported even after self-healing, for the same reason
#            #2292 reports: how long a seat enforced a config main did not
#            author is the thing worth knowing, regardless of who fixed it.
#
# and one warn-only observation:
#
#   UNAUTHORED — an object under vaults/ whose customer.yaml is gone from git.
#            Warned about, never deleted. See "never deletes" below.
#
# WHAT IT WILL NOT DO:
#   - Never creates. A 404 on the object is a SKIP with a warning. The first
#     publish binds a config to a Machine, a volume and a secret set, and stays
#     Captain-gated (ci-publish-customer-configs.sh:193-207). Any head-object
#     failure that is NOT a 404 is a hard error, never a skip: "could not tell"
#     must not read as "no object here".
#   - Never deletes. Retirement is manual. This is structural, not a rule to
#     remember: the republish loop's universe is the set of customer.yaml files
#     on HEAD, and there is no delete call anywhere in this script.
#   - Never writes any other key. assert_config_key re-checks the assembled key
#     against a whole-string pattern before every write, same constant basename
#     and same canonical slug pattern (#2285) the publisher uses.
#
# WHY THE SHALLOW REFUSAL IS LOAD-BEARING HERE. The byte comparison alone would
# survive a depth-1 clone (HEAD's tree and files are present). The REPORT would
# not: a finding names the commit and date that authored the current bytes, via
# `git log -1 -- <path>`, which in a shallow slice reports the newest commit IN
# THE SLICE. "This seat has been serving the wrong config since <today>" is a
# confident lie, and the age is the whole point of reporting a self-healed
# drift. Refuse rather than emit it.
#
# bash 3.2 compatible on purpose — like both siblings, this is exercised by a
# test suite that may run on a macOS operator box. No mapfile, no associative
# arrays, no bare `"${arr[@]}"` under `set -u`.
#
# Inputs (env):
#   R2_RECONCILE_DRY_RUN=1   detect and report; never write to R2.
#   R2_BUCKET_CONFIG         override the bucket (default smd-customer-config).
# R2 auth: R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID / R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY / R2_ENDPOINT_URL if set,
# otherwise derived from CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN + CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID exactly as
# the publisher derives them (derive, never mint).
#
# The reconcile ref is HEAD, deliberately not configurable: a ref that differed
# from the checkout would compare against one commit and publish another.
#
# Exit codes (the #2292 HOLDS-vs-FINDS contract, unchanged):
#   0  converged — every authored seat's object is byte-identical to its blob
#   1  cannot evaluate, or a republish failed to land (the control itself is
#      broken; a failed workflow run is the right noise for that)
#   2  findings — at least one object drifted (the workflow opens an issue)
