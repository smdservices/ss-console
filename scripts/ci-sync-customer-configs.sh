# CI auto-sync: customer.yaml + routine-grid.yaml (git source of truth) →
# customer_configs D1 projection (#1308 auto-sync extension, ADR 0012 §5,
# ADR 0075).
#
# Closes the stale-projection window: before this job, a merged customer.yaml
# change never reached the live portal until someone remembered to re-project
# by hand — the mechanism behind the "removed in git but still shows live"
# failure class (see feedback: the persona-name saga, 2026-07-08/13). The
# routine-grid.yaml (ADR 0075) is a sibling artifact projected into the same
# row, so a grid-only merge must sync too.
#
# Behavior per changed slug (deduped across both watched files):
#   - Row exists in customer_configs  → re-project via the canonical script
#     (validates BOTH files, provenance-guarded, idempotent SQL) and apply
#     --remote. The upsert deliberately never updates entity_id, so a routine
#     CI sync can never repoint a config to a different client (cross-tenant
#     guard, see customer-config-projection.ts).
#   - No row (never seeded)           → WARN and skip. The FIRST projection
#     of a new customer stays a Captain-gated manual step (it binds the
#     config to an owning entity).
#
# Inputs (env): BEFORE_SHA, AFTER_SHA — the push range from the workflow.
