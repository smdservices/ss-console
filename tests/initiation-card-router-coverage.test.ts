/**
 * Initiation-card -> router coverage gate (#2222).
 *
 * The runtime fact this encodes: on the ONLY channel a firm actually uses to
 * talk to its Operator (inbound email), the core pre-loads the routed skill's
 * body into the user message and nothing else. The skills index is absent, and
 * `skill_view` is not on the webhook tool surface (live probe, pilot-smokeball,
 * 2026-08-11: 15 tools, no `skill_view`). So `matter-inbox-router/SKILL.md` is
 * the only skill text the model reads on an email turn.
 *
 * That is how the depth-2 introduce row shipped unmapped. The card told the
 * firm to say "Walk me through what you'll do each day and week."; the phrase
 * appeared nowhere in the router body; the model improvised a fluent roster.
 * `tests/initiation-card.test.ts` pins schema, `backed_by` resolution, and seat
 * binding, and none of those could see the gap.
 *
 * The property: every unlocked card row promising an OPERATOR-DIRECTED skill
 * must have its phrasing present in the router body.
 *
 * WHY `SKILL.md` ONLY, never `references/*.md`. The reference files are LISTED
 * by name in the skill body; they are not loaded on the email channel. Matching
 * against them would green exactly the state that produced the incident:
 * `references/routing-rubric.md` already carries the depth-1 phrasing, so a gate
 * that counted references would have passed on an unmapped depth-2 row too. A
 * gate that passes on the state that produced the incident measured nothing.
 *
 * SCOPING PREDICATE (the part that has to be right, or the gate is noise). A row
 * is in scope iff all of:
 *   - its stage is not `locked`,
 *   - `backed_by !== 'core-dialogue'`,
 *   - the backing skill's frontmatter has `metadata.smd.vertical === 'neutral'`.
 *
 * The third clause is principled, not curve-fitted: a `neutral` product skill is
 * one the sender invokes BY NAMING IT, so the naming has to be in the router's
 * text. A vertical (law-firm, marketing-agency) skill is reached by the router
 * CLASSIFYING the message, and classification is already covered by the class
 * table and the rubric. If you are adding a card row and are unsure which side
 * of the line it falls on: does the client's sentence name a procedure the
 * Operator runs on itself, or describe firm work? The first is in scope.
 *
 * ESCAPE HATCH. A row may carry `router_exempt: <reason>` (>= 20 characters).
 * The exemption is reviewable in the diff, which is the point: it keeps the gate
 * from being deleted the first time it is inconvenient.
