/**
 * routine_names drift gate (#2222).
 *
 * Both seats author a top-level `routine_names:` map (skill slug -> the
 * routine's firm-legible name). Its runtime consumer is the operator-introduce
 * skill, which reads it off the seat's own /var/lib/smd-config/customer.yaml
 * so an admin can ask "what are your routines?" and hear the names the firm
 * was actually promised. The names originate in the routine-grid rows (which
 * themselves trace verbatim to the client letter), so this gate pins the map
 * to the grid the same way the grid is pinned to the letter:
 *
 *   1. every routine_names key is a skill bound on that seat's persona;
 *   2. every skill named by a routine-grid row has a routine_names entry;
 *   3. the entry's value equals the row's `routine:` byte-for-byte.
 *
 * Without (3), the introduce reply and the routines detail document the firm
 * holds can drift apart, which is exactly the card falsifier ("a schedule
 * that contradicts the document the firm holds") in name form.
