/**
 * The console → vault writer for authored output-class specs (ADR 0083, #2089).
 *
 * Three properties are load-bearing enough that a regression would be silent
 * and would reach a client's running Operator:
 *
 *  1. ONE KEY SPACE. This module writes `vaults/<slug>/output-classes.json`
 *     and can address nothing else. `customer.yaml` beside it is
 *     git-authoritative and published by CI; a portal write there would be
 *     clobbered by the next unrelated merge to that slug. The mirror-image
 *     guard lives in `tests/config-publish-guards.test.ts`.
 *  2. THE HASH IS COMPUTED HERE. A digest arriving with a request is never
 *     read; the one written beside each body is computed over the bytes about
 *     to be written.
 *  3. NO SUCCESS FOR A WRITE THAT DID NOT HAPPEN. `writeSpecDocument` reports
 *     ok only after reading the object back byte-identical.
 *  4. THE STORED BYTES ARE LF-ONLY. A browser textarea submits CRLF. Nothing
 *     would fail loudly if it survived — the digest matches its own CRLF body,
 *     so the applier verifies and installs it — and the seat would hold a file
 *     whose every line carries a trailing `\r`.
 *
 * No live R2. `FakeBucket` implements the two methods the module uses and can
 * be told to drop or corrupt a write, so the read-back proof is exercised
 * rather than assumed.
 *
 * The last block pins the READING half: ADR 0085 §7 demoted the portal's
 * authoring form to a read-only window, and the writer above it stayed exactly
 * where it was. A form returning to that view would reinstate the experience
 * the ADR removed and put a second writer beside the conversational one.
