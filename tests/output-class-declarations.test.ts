/**
 * A declared spec expectation must be one somebody can actually satisfy.
 *
 * WHY THIS GATE EXISTS. `output_classes.<class>.voice_spec: expected` is not a
 * preference — it BINDS the overlay's spec gate. A bound class whose spec is
 * absent or whose hash does not match the root manifest fails closed: that
 * class's autonomous sends downgrade to draft, and they stay downgraded until
 * someone installs a spec. That is correct, and it is the whole reason the
 * declaration exists (see sections-output-classes.ts).
 *
 * It also means a declaration nobody can satisfy is not a harmless typo. It is
 * a silent, permanent downgrade of a class of output, with no error anywhere
 * and nothing on the seat to explain it. A class slug misspelled here, or one
 * the portal writer cannot address, produces exactly that.
 *
 * So this asserts the loop closes: every class declared `expected` on any seat
 * exists in the class registry, and the console → vault writer can produce a
 * key and a document body for it. The producer and the expectation are checked
 * against each other rather than each against its own idea of the vocabulary.
 *
 * This is the repo half of #2094. The runtime half — the spec installing
 * root-owned, the gate passing on a read turn and downgrading on a turn that
 * did not read — is observed on a seat and cannot be closed here.
