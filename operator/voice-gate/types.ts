 * v1 base cohorts per PRD §9.3 Layer 3: `client`, `opposing-counsel`,
 * `court`, `internal`. Issue #857 added `court` and `internal` to the
 * union when the cohort vocabulary was lifted into the schema.
 *
 * `internal-team` is preserved as a legacy alias so archived blind-
 * test runs scored against the old PR-#857-predates label keep
 * rendering. New runs should use `internal`. The legacy slug stays in
 * the union but does NOT appear in `BASE_VOICE_COHORTS`; customers
 * who want it must opt in via their own `voice_cohorts.cohorts[]`
 * declaration.
 *
 * New cohorts must be added here AND threaded through the panel +
 * fixture loader + scoring; the closed union prevents silent drift.
