"""Cross-language capability-name contract (Python mirror).

The canonical CapabilityName union lives in
``src/lib/operator/capabilities/types.ts``; this frozenset is its Python
mirror, kept in lockstep by the google connector conformance test. When one
side changes, the other MUST change in the same PR.

History: this constant originally lived in ``connectors/filevine/errors.py``.
The filevine / no_pm / lawpay adapter packages were deleted on Captain's
2026-06-12 code-review decision (ADR 0020 went MCP-first; the build:/
synthetic: adapters had zero runtime wiring — nothing materializes them into
tools — and their smoke harness referenced a script that never existed). The
contract constant is the one piece the live google suite still needed.
