"""operator_connector_sdk — the contract every author-built MCP connector is built on.

Deliberately minimal. It ships exactly the pieces with teeth:

- ``ConnectorServer`` — a stdio MCP server base that guarantees each tool ships a
  well-formed, non-empty ``inputSchema`` where Hermes' MCP client reads it.
- ``ConnectorManifest`` — the in-package self-description (capability, required
  secret *names*, ``auth_model``, and ``tool_classes`` as a conformance ORACLE).
- the conformance harness — spawns/introspects the server and proves the tool
  surface is well-formed and that every live tool is classified under its
  *runtime-prefixed* name (``mcp_<server>_<tool>``), the exact thing that has
  slipped governance before.

What is NOT here: auth-strategy base classes (deferred until a real
static/client_credentials connector exists) and the enforced tool->ActionClass
map. The enforced map is the hand-authored literal in the overlay
(``shared/action_classes.py``); the manifest's ``tool_classes`` is only the
oracle a conformance test checks that map against. Trust is reviewed in the
trust repo, not self-certified here.
