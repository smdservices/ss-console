"""Whitfield v. Pacific Freight Lines — the record for staging matter 2026-PI-104.

WHY THIS SET EXISTS. The happy-path record for the demand-letter drafter.
2026-PI-102 (chen_pi102) cannot produce a cleanly green card 18: suit is filed
there, and the demand skeleton is a PRE-SUIT CCP 999 mechanism, so the drafter
will always and correctly flag the posture. This matter is pre-suit, its own
description says "approaching settlement", and a demand letter is the thing it
needs next. Completing it is additive; no other fixture's purpose is disturbed.

AUTHORED AGAINST THE RECORD THAT WAS ALREADY THERE, WHICH IS THE WHOLE LESSON.
On 2026-PI-102 I wrote nine documents without reading the matter's own Complaint
and put the incident in the wrong state on the wrong date. So every figure below
was written after reading the three lien documents already on this matter, and
reconciles to them:

  * MedFin Capital advanced $12,500.00 "for MRI and orthopedic consultation".
    The MRI ($3,150.00) and the orthopedic consultation and injection
    ($9,350.00) below total EXACTLY $12,500.00.
  * The Kaiser lien names "the injury of 11/02/2025", so that is the date of
    loss throughout, and Kaiser is the treating plan for the emergency and
    physical-therapy course.
  * DHCS asserts a Medi-Cal lien, so this is a California matter.

BILLED ONLY, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. Three lienholders assert against this
recovery (MedFin $12,500.00, Kaiser $9,310.02, DHCS $18,762.44 "subject to
revision"). Billed charges, amounts paid, and amounts recoverable are three
different numbers here, and the record does not resolve them. The billing
summary says so rather than inventing a reconciliation. A demand that totals
billed charges as though they were the loss is a real drafting error, and this
fixture is built so the drafter has to notice.

DESIGNED SO THE FALSIFIER CAN FIRE, same as chen_pi102: specials that trace, and
NO demand amount, NO general-damages figure, NO settlement number anywhere. The
policy limit stays because it is a disclosed coverage fact, not a valuation.

NO PERIODS IN DOCUMENT NAMES. Smokeball reads the tail after a "." as a file
extension and drops it ("Dr. Raghunathan" would arrive as "Dr").

CONSULTATION, December 18, 2025

Mr Whitfield presents on referral for right lower extremity radicular pain
following a rear-end motor vehicle collision on November 2, 2025 in which his
stopped vehicle was struck by a tractor-trailer.

MRI of December 8, 2025 demonstrates a right paracentral disc extrusion at L4-L5
displacing the traversing right L5 nerve root. Findings correlate with the
clinical examination.

Examination confirms a positive straight-leg raise on the right at 40 degrees,
sensory diminishment in the right L5 distribution, and 5/5 motor strength
throughout. No cauda equina signs.

Recommendation: transforaminal epidural steroid injection at right L4-L5,
followed by a structured physical therapy course. Surgical intervention is not
indicated at this time and would be considered only on progression or failure of
conservative care. Risks, benefits and alternatives discussed.

PROCEDURE, January 6, 2026

Right L4-L5 transforaminal epidural steroid injection performed under
fluoroscopic guidance. Contrast confirmed appropriate epidural spread. No
immediate complication. Patient discharged in stable condition and referred to
physical therapy.

CAPITAL PHYSICAL THERAPY
DISCHARGE SUMMARY

Patient:  James Whitfield
Referral: Priya Raghunathan, MD
Course:   January 13, 2026 through March 8, 2026, 20 sessions
Date:     March 8, 2026

COURSE OF CARE
Lumbar stabilization, nerve glide, and progressive strengthening following a
right L4-L5 transforaminal epidural steroid injection on January 6, 2026. Course
was uninterrupted; the patient attended all twenty scheduled sessions.

STATUS AT DISCHARGE
Radicular pain reduced from 6/10 at intake to 2/10, described as intermittent
and activity dependent. Straight-leg raise negative on the right at discharge.
Lumbar flexion improved from 40 to 65 degrees. Sensory diminishment in the right
L5 distribution persists on examination.

Lifting tolerance measured at 35 pounds occasional, against a pre-injury job
demand of 75 pounds occasional. Mr Whitfield reports that overhead work and
sustained kneeling continue to provoke symptoms.

RECOMMENDATION
Discharged to an independent home program. No further supervised therapy
recommended at this time. Follow up with the referring physician regarding work
status and any residual restriction.

RAGHUNATHAN ORTHOPEDIC SPINE

Patient: James Whitfield
Date:    March 12, 2026
Injury:  November 2, 2025, motor vehicle collision

STATUS
Mr Whitfield completed twenty sessions of physical therapy following the
January 6, 2026 injection and was discharged from therapy on March 8, 2026.
Radicular pain has improved from 6/10 to an intermittent 2/10. Straight-leg
raise is negative. Sensory diminishment in the right L5 distribution persists.

MAXIMUM MEDICAL IMPROVEMENT
Reached March 8, 2026.

WORK STATUS
Mr Whitfield is a licensed electrician, an occupation requiring repetitive
lifting to 75 pounds, overhead work, and sustained kneeling. He was held off
work entirely from November 3, 2025 through January 25, 2026, and released to
light duty limited to 20 hours per week from January 26, 2026 through March 8,
2026. He was released to full duty without restriction effective March 9, 2026.

PROGNOSIS
The L4-L5 extrusion remains present on imaging. Residual sensory diminishment is
likely permanent to some degree. Future care may include repeat injection on
recurrence, and surgical decompression would be considered only on progression.
No further treatment is scheduled at this time.

WHAT THIS SUMMARY DOES NOT ESTABLISH

These are BILLED charges. They are not amounts paid, and they are not amounts
recoverable. Three lienholders assert against any recovery on this matter, and
their assertions are on file separately:

  MedFin Capital LLC, payoff statement of June 2, 2026
  Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, third-party liability assertion of May 28, 2026
  California Department of Health Care Services, lien notice of May 19, 2026

The DHCS figure is stated by the Department to be subject to revision until a
final itemization issues. The relationship between billed charges, amounts paid,
and the sums the lienholders may recover is NOT resolved anywhere in this file.
Do not total the figures above as though they were the measure of the medical
loss, and do not net them against the liens without instruction.

The third-party funded subtotal above corresponds to the care MedFin advanced
against, which its payoff statement describes as the MRI and the orthopedic
consultation.
