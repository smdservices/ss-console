"""The compiler that makes "we copied nothing" checkable (ss ADR 0083).

Ordered by what an unrelated refactor is most likely to break silently:

1. A NAME-SWAPPED copy is still a copy. This is the whole reason masking exists
   and the cheapest evasion a distiller makes under budget pressure. If this
   test goes green after someone "simplifies" normalization, the guarantee is
   gone and nothing else here notices.
2. The report never echoes the matched text. A refusal that prints the prose
   makes the audit trail the largest copy of the thing it protects.
3. A characterization passes where a quotation fails — the check must not be so
   blunt that writing ABOUT the corpus is impossible.
