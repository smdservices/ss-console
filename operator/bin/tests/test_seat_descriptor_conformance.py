"""Every customer.yaml declares what its seat IS.

WHY THIS GATE EXISTS. Nothing in this repo said what a seat was. `fly status`
reports `started` for a Machine serving nobody; the only `status:` in any
customer.yaml is on the persona and reads `active` on all eight seats including
`_template`; and the single place recording "ashton-price has no live Machine"
was a prose sentence in an upgrade runbook that had since gone stale. A seat
provisioned, connected to nothing, and serving no one was described in this
session as a live client seat on exactly that evidence.

WHY THE VALIDATOR DOES NOT ENFORCE THIS. `seat:` validates as OPTIONAL. The
portal's `reconstructFromProjection` builds a synthetic customer.yaml root out
of lossy D1 columns and hands it to the same validator; a required field the
projection cannot carry would turn the settings editor into a config error for
every customer. That is #1965 exactly, and making this block required would
have rebuilt it. So shape is proven in the validator and COMPLETENESS is proven
here, where the real files are in reach and no projection is involved.

    cd operator && python3 -m pytest bin/tests/test_seat_descriptor_conformance.py -v
