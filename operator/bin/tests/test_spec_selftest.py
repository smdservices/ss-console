"""Running a spec's rules against the writing they were derived from.

The failure this prevents is specific and was observed: a candidate card stated
a threshold as a hard gate, called it "the load-bearing number", and three of
the firm's own letters violated it. Nothing anywhere would have noticed, because
nothing ran the rules against the corpus.

Ordered by which failure ships a bad gate rather than a broken build:

1. An unknown rule kind must DEMOTE, never silently pass. A rule this module
   cannot evaluate that reads as evaluated-and-approved is the exact shape of
   every false-confidence defect in this subsystem.
2. A block rule the corpus violates must demote AND name the documents, because
   the documents are the information the firm needs to resolve it.
3. Unlabeled corpora gate on everything. The permissive reading — only labeled
   documents gate, so an unlabeled corpus gates on nothing — would turn the
   whole check off by omission.
