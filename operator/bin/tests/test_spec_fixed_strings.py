"""The layer that lets a no-verbatim spec still represent a law firm.

Ordered by which failure is worst:

1. The exemption becoming a BYPASS. If an unapproved corpus sentence passes
   once approvals are loaded, the whole guarantee is void and nothing else here
   matters.
2. The detector self-approving. Proposal and permission are different powers
   and the split is the safety property.
3. Missing the thing it was written to find. The first cut of this module found
   ZERO candidates on a corpus whose signature close recurs in four documents,
   because sentence granularity cut the two-sentence close in half.
