#!/usr/bin/env bash
# reprovision-staging.sh — (re)provision the STAGING Operator: the permanent,
# faithful pre-production gate for Operator lifecycle work.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: a world-class deploy process never tests changes to the
# deploy/boot/voice/env machinery on the one live customer. This stands up
# hermes-smd-staging from the EXACT same tooling as production, so every cut is
# proven here before it touches a real customer.
#
# ISOLATION (the load-bearing part): the normal reprovision injects every
# Infisical /ss key as an env var, and provision-customer.sh stages the
# customer-owned ones (GOOGLE_*, CLIO_*, AGENTMAIL_*, SMOKEBALL_*, webhook
# secrets, the per-seat Anthropic key) onto the Machine. Those are REAL customer
# credentials. This wrapper isolates staging from ALL of them.
#
# FAIL-CLOSED (2026-07 rework, issue #1783). The previous version blanked a
# HAND-MAINTAINED DENYLIST (`CLIO_*` only) and so failed OPEN: any customer-owned
# secret it did not name (AgentMail, Smokeball, per-seat Anthropic, webhook
# secrets) leaked onto the staging box the moment a staging seat bound that
# connector. This version derives the isolate set from the custody classification
# (operator/bin/lib/secret_custody.py, sourced from
# operator/contracts/env-consumption.yaml + the connector tables), so a NEWLY
# added customer-owned secret is isolated automatically. The classification's
# completeness against provision-customer.sh is CI-enforced
# (operator/bin/tests/test_secret_custody.py::test_every_staged_secret_is_classified),
# which is what makes this allowlist trustworthy.
#
# Two isolation moves:
#   - BLANK every customer-owned secret (contract-driven) so the real value never
#     reaches the staging Machine.
#   - SUBSTITUTE GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON with a freshly generated ISOLATED
#     service account (gen-staging-google-cred.py): Google is customer-by-EFFECT
#     (DWD impersonation), so the broker still needs *a* credential to boot
#     identically to prod — wired to nothing real.
# Result: staging borrows none of the live business's access.
#
# The slug is HARDCODED to smd-staging. This wrapper must never touch a real
# customer.
#
# Usage:  operator/bin/reprovision-staging.sh
