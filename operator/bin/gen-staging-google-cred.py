"""Generate an ISOLATED, throwaway Google service-account JSON for the staging
Operator (hermes-smd-staging).

It is a structurally-valid service account with a freshly generated RSA keypair,
so the Workspace broker boots IDENTICALLY to production (entrypoint.sh's
`materialize_credential` decodes + writes it; `from_service_account_info` can
construct a Credentials object from it). But it is wired to a fictitious
project/account with no domain-wide delegation to anything real, so it can
authenticate against NO Google resource. boot-smoke and the voice gate never
make a live Google call, so the staging broker never needs this to actually
work against Google — only to be a well-formed credential.

This is NEVER a real credential and is NEVER committed. The staging reprovision
wrapper base64-encodes stdout into the GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON Fly secret on
the staging Machine only. A fresh key is generated on every provision, which is
fine — staging holds no persistent Google state.

Run via uv so cryptography is available without a repo dependency:
    uv run --quiet --with cryptography python3 operator/bin/gen-staging-google-cred.py
