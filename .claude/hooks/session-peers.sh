# Session Peers Hook (SessionStart) -- peripheral vision for concurrent work.
#
# Sessions on this repo cannot see each other. Handoffs are written at /eos,
# so a session in flight is invisible to every other one, and the SOS briefing
# shows the newest CLOSED session. On 2026-07-31 that meant five concurrent
# sessions, 22 merges in 36 hours, and every briefing describing a world from
# that morning: the newest handoff a session could see predated roughly ten
# merges that had already landed.
#
# This prints what a session cannot otherwise learn: who else is live, and
# what arrived on main ahead of it. Both are read straight off the filesystem
# and the local git refs -- no network, no `gh`, no credentials, no API.
#
# Registered with NO matcher, deliberately. The sibling sync-primary.sh uses
# matcher "startup" and additionally exits in worktrees, so copying either
# choice would silence this hook in the sessions that most need it: the
# worktree sessions, which are where all mutating work happens.
#
# Wire protocol:
#   stdin:  JSON with .cwd (Claude Code hook contract)
#   stdout: injected into the session's context
#   exit 0 always; never block startup on a diagnostic.

# Resolve the tree this session is in. Payload .cwd first: CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR
# is pinned at launch and does not follow EnterWorktree, so preferring it

# --- Live peers -------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The lock files are written by Claude Code itself when a session enters a
# worktree; nothing in this repo writes them. They carry a pid, which is the
# only liveness signal available, and a dead pid means an abandoned worktree
# rather than a peer. Unlocked worktrees are reported without a pid because
# a session may hold one without the harness having locked it.
# Each worktree's path comes from its own `gitdir` file, which records the
# absolute path of its .git link. Deriving it from the current tree instead
# (as a sibling directory) is only correct when read FROM a worktree and
# silently finds nothing when read from the primary, where the worktrees live
# under .claude/worktrees/ rather than alongside.

# states the session's focus. This hook's own pid parent IS the claude
# process, which is the one pid signal worth recording.
