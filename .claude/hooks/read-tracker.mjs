/**
 * read-tracker.mjs -- PostToolUse hook on Read. Two jobs:
 *
 *  1. LOG: append the `operator/customers/...` suffix of every Read target to
 *     a per-session read log. The log is what engagement-guard.mjs consults to
 *     decide whether this session has loaded an engagement's dossier before
 *     writing into that engagement.
 *
 *  2. ADVISE (radar tier, Law 2): a Read of engagement correspondence
 *     without a prior read of that engagement's dossier.md emits an
 *     advisory to the model (exit 2 on PostToolUse surfaces stderr WITHOUT
 *     undoing the Read -- the tool already ran; nothing is blocked). This
 *     covers the analysis path: reviews that never write a file.
 *
 * CROSS-REPO. Engagement material lives in the private `venturecrane/engagements`
 * repo, so the dossier read logged here and the write it later authorizes are
 * routinely in different checkouts. The log therefore lives at ONE absolute
 * location shared by every repo and worktree; deriving it from the project dir
 * would split it in two and silently make the guard unsatisfiable. See
 * .claude/hooks/lib/engagement-paths.mjs.
 *
 * Suffix matching everywhere: paths are recorded and compared by their
 * `operator/customers/...` suffix, so worktree, primary-checkout, and
 * engagements-repo absolute paths never mismatch.
 *
 * Incident: 2026-07-26 Christa-reply session -- a client letter was
 * critiqued with the engagement posture unread. See Law 2,
 * docs/doctrine/agent-operating-doctrine.md.
 *
 * Failure posture: FAIL OPEN, silently. This is workflow hygiene in the
 * worktree-guard idiom, not a safety gate.
