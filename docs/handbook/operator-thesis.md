## What the Operator is

The Operator is SMD's productized monthly retainer product (the SKU itself is defined in [ADR 0004](https://github.com/venturecrane/ss-console/blob/main/docs/adr/0004-productized-operator-offering.md); see `/admin/playbook/business-model` for how it sits as a second front door). ADR 0037 is the doctrine that says what the product *is*, separate from how it is sold. Load it before any Operator strategy, marketing, competitive, or vertical-selection work, so it is built upon and not re-derived. The thesis was locked because the perspective kept drifting back toward stale framings in successive sessions: the product as a fixed comms-drafting tool, draft-for-review send as "the moat," draft-for-review as "the default."

This page is a pointer. It orients, then points to the deeper product pages.

## It competes with a hire, not with software

This is the mission-critical tenet (ADR 0037, Tenet 1). The Operator's rival is the next *person* a business would hire: coordinator, intake lead, paralegal, client-service associate, office manager. Never a software product.

Every system a business runs does a *subset* of the work. The human is what connects them: reading the email, updating the matter, chasing the document, logging it, booking the follow-up. The Operator is that connective tissue.

Three consequences fall out of this:

- Existing systems (Clio, the AMS, the PSA) are **connection targets, not competitors**. An incumbent suite shipping an in-app AI feature is a system to connect across, not a reason to score a market down.
- The more disconnected systems a business runs, the **more** an Operator is worth, not less.
- We price against a **salary**, not a software seat. See `/admin/playbook/pricing-economics`.

## The four dimensions it wins on

The Operator competes with a hire and wins on dimensions a hire cannot match:

1. **Memory that compounds.** Per-customer operating memory deepens over time and raises switching cost. A new hire starts from zero; the Operator's memory is an accumulating asset. See `/admin/playbook/knowledge-memory`.
2. **Configurable autonomy.** What it may do is authored per engagement on two independent axes (initiation and exposure), per action class, per [ADR 0025](https://github.com/venturecrane/ss-console/blob/main/docs/adr/0025-autonomy-ceilings-configurable-exposure-vs-initiation.md). See `/admin/playbook/autonomy-governance`.
3. **No context-switching cost.** It does not multitask away from the work, forget a handoff, or drop a thread between systems.
4. **Enterprise discipline at an SMB price.** Code-enforced trust, provenance, and audit, delivered to businesses that have never had access to it.

These are capabilities, not the moat. Per Tenet 4, naming any single feature "the moat" is a category error.

## The six tenets of ADR 0037

The full doctrine. Cite the tenet number when you reason from it.

1. **It competes with a hire, not with software.** (mission-critical) Incumbent systems are connection targets; price against a salary.
2. **It is a configurable substrate, not a tool with a use case.** Authored per engagement across skills, entitlements, voice, connectors, and memory. The only hard limit is connectability. Never reason about it as if it has one shape.
3. **No imposed defaults.** The harness assumes no posture. Unconfigured is fail-closed, which is a safety property, not an identity. Ask "what did the engagement author?", never "what does the system assume?"
4. **The moat is the harness plus the guide plus the memory, never a single feature.** Three scarce, compounding things: configurable trust enforced in code (the harness), the human who authors it well (the guide), the per-customer memory (the memory). Do not build positioning on one feature.
5. **Packs turn the universal into the recognizable.** "All things to all people" is the capability; "exactly your thing" is how we sell it. A pack ([ADR 0022](https://github.com/venturecrane/ss-console/blob/main/docs/adr/0022-vertical-pack-architecture.md)) refines the substrate for a vertical. Packs compose and cluster into families that share DNA, so building one compounds the next. See `/admin/playbook/vertical-packs`.
6. **Targeting is market-driven, on reachability times willingness-to-pay.** Choose verticals where the coordinator role is most acute and expensive, the audience most cheaply reachable, and willingness-to-pay (against a salary) highest. The guide is a resource we supply, not a constraint on which market to pick.

## Where to go from here

- `/admin/playbook/operator-platform` - how the substrate is built (per-customer Fly.io Machine, Hermes runtime, plugin-only overlay).
- `/admin/playbook/autonomy-governance` - the entitlement axes and how trust is configured and enforced.
- `/admin/playbook/knowledge-memory` - the memory that compounds.
- `/admin/playbook/vertical-packs` - how packs turn the universal into the recognizable.
- `/admin/playbook/business-model` - the two front doors and where the Operator sits in the firm.
