## How to use this page

Definitions are short on purpose - one to three sentences each. Where a term carries more weight than a definition can hold, the entry points at the page or ADR that owns it. Terms are grouped: the business, the product and its architecture, governance, infrastructure, and tooling.

## The business and the people

**Captain.** The human principal who authorizes decisions. In this venture the Captain is Scott Durgan, the founder. A decision becomes canon only when the Captain authorizes it; the agent can propose but never self-govern (ADR 0030).

**The fleet.** The set of machines and agent sessions that do the venture's work. Tasks can be dispatched to fleet machines (see the `crane_fleet_dispatch` tooling) and run in parallel. Distinct from the Operator's per-customer Machines, which are customer runtime, not the fleet.

**VCMS.** The enterprise memory and notes system (the "venture content management system") reached through the crane MCP. Agents never auto-save to VCMS without explicit Captain approval (CLAUDE.md, content-policy).

**crane MCP.** The shared enterprise tooling server (tools prefixed `crane_`) that loads session context, documentation, secrets verification, notifications, and memory. Every session starts by calling `crane_preflight` then `crane_sos` (CLAUDE.md, Session Start).

## The Operator and its architecture

**Operator.** SMD's productized monthly-retainer product: a configurable AI worker stood up per customer (ADR 0004, named in ADR 0034). It competes with a hire, not with software; incumbent systems are connection targets, not competitors (ADR 0037). Renamed from "AI employee"; never write "AI employee" as the product. See [The Operator Thesis](/admin/playbook/operator-thesis).

**harness / guide / memory.** The three things that together form the Operator's moat, per ADR 0037 Tenet 4. The harness is the runtime and its governance; the guide is the operational expertise SMD supplies; the memory is what the Operator learns about the customer's business. No single feature is the moat - calling one feature "the moat" is a category error.

**Hermes (the substrate).** The third-party agent runtime the Operator is built on: `NousResearch/hermes-agent` (MIT-licensed). The architectural posture is "Hermes is the substrate, trust it" - skills, memory, the tool registry, MCP integration, and approval machinery are native and not reinvented (CLAUDE.md, Operator Architecture; ADR 0015).

**the overlay (hermes-smd-overlay).** SMD's own code that runs on top of Hermes, hosted in a separate repo `venturecrane/hermes-smd-overlay`. It is plugin-only: it MUST NOT modify Hermes core files. We build only what Hermes won't (CLAUDE.md, Operator Architecture; ADR 0015).

**customer.yaml.** The per-customer configuration artifact that declares everything about one Operator: skills, entitlements, voice, connectors, personas, memory, schedules. Git is its source of truth, with portal D1 and per-customer R2 as materialized replicas (ADR 0012). It is also a security boundary (ADR 0026).

**vertical pack.** A quick-start template that configures an Operator for a specific industry (law, marketing, insurance, etc.). Packs turn the universal capability into something recognizable to a customer (ADR 0037 Tenet 5; architecture in ADR 0022). A pack is a starting point, not a claim of expertise in the client's business. See [Vertical Packs](/admin/playbook/vertical-packs).

**persona.** A distinct identity an Operator can present, implemented as a Hermes profile (ADR 0011). One customer can have multiple personas; v1 ships one. Switching is done through Hermes' native `/handoff`.

## Governance and safety

**action class.** A coarse grouping of operations (for example read, send, destructive, code-execution) used to express entitlement at a manageable grain. Entitlement is set per action class per identity, which keeps the policy linear rather than per-operation exponential (ADR 0025).

**autonomy ceiling (initiation x exposure).** The cap on what an Operator may do, expressed on two independent axes: autonomy-of-initiation (may it act on its own?) and autonomy-of-exposure (may its output reach the outside world?). Ceilings are configurable per action class, code-enforced, audited, and the agent can never raise its own ceiling (ADR 0025, companion ADR 0026).

**fail-closed.** The default safety state: an entitled action with no authored entitlement is refused - no send, no draft, nothing (ADR 0035). Unconfigured is a safety state, not an identity; the harness imposes no defaults (ADR 0037 Tenet 3).

**taint gate.** An injection defense: a turn that has been fed untrusted external content is marked (a sticky session taint) and cannot then autonomously send, destroy, or execute. It is an integrity control, not an entitlement - authoring it off opens a hole and grants no capability (ADR 0027).

**broker.** A mediating service that holds connector credentials outside the agent runtime and validates each operation against what the engagement authored, so the agent never holds the raw credential. It is the authorization boundary for mediated connectors (ADR 0045).

**DWD (domain-wide delegation).** A Google Workspace mechanism that lets a service account act as a specific user for a specific operation. The Operator uses per-operation DWD subjects, validated by the broker against the authored managed-mailbox list, to manage a principal's mailbox.

## Infrastructure and connectivity

**MCP.** Model Context Protocol - the standard interface by which the Operator connects to external tools and services. The connector strategy is MCP-first: use a vendor or vetted-community MCP server where one exists (ADR 0020).

**connector backends (`mcp:` / `build:` / `synthetic:`).** The three kinds of connector an Operator can wire, by `customer.yaml.connectors{}` prefix. `mcp:` is a vendor or vetted-community MCP server (preferred). `build:` is a Python adapter SMD maintains, used only when no acceptable MCP exists. `synthetic:` is the no-PM substrate (a stand-in when the customer has no practice-management system). Composio was dropped in the 2026-05-30 revision of ADR 0020.

**Honcho.** A memory subsystem within Hermes that draws conclusions about people the Operator interacts with. SMD's disposition is "mirror, don't gate": conclusions are mirrored to per-customer D1 with provenance, and Captain dismissal triggers a physical delete from Honcho (ADR 0016).

## The two-layer taxonomy

**The two-layer taxonomy.** SMD keeps two deliberately distinct lists of what it does (ADR 0001). The **delivery taxonomy** has six categories (process design, custom internal tools, systems integration, operational visibility, vendor/platform selection, AI & automation) and is the marketing and doctrine source of truth. The **observation taxonomy** has five IDs (`process_design`, `tool_systems`, `data_visibility`, `customer_pipeline`, `team_operations`, in `src/portal/assessments/extraction-schema.ts`) and is the operational pain the lead-gen layer detects from public data. Outreach speaks observation, marketing speaks delivery, and the assessment call is the bridge - do not conflate them.
