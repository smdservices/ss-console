# API Accounts & Configuration Checklist

External accounts, API keys, and configurations required to run all 5 lead generation pipelines. Ordered by priority: Pipeline 2 (Job Monitor) first, since it has the fewest dependencies and is the fastest to validate end-to-end.

**Estimated time:** 30-45 minutes for all account setup and configuration.

---

## Order of Operations

1. **Verify accounts you already have** (5-10 min)
2. **Sign up for new services** (5-10 min)
3. **Configure Google Cloud** if needed (5-10 min)
4. **Create Make.com connections** (5-10 min)
5. **Set up Slack channel and Google Sheets** (5 min)
6. **Create Make.com Data Stores** (5 min)

Pipeline 2 (Job Monitor) requires only: SerpAPI + Anthropic + Google Sheets + Slack. Complete those first and validate the pipeline before configuring the remaining accounts.

## Quick Reference: What Each Pipeline Needs

| Pipeline                       | External Services                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pipeline 1 — Review Mining     | Outscraper, Google Places API, Anthropic, Sheets, Slack |
| Pipeline 2 — Job Monitor       | SerpAPI, Anthropic, Sheets, Slack                       |
| Pipeline 3 — New Business      | SODA APIs, Gmail, Anthropic, Sheets, Slack              |
| Pipeline 4 — Social Listening  | Reddit (no auth), Google Alerts (Gmail), Sheets, Slack  |
| Pipeline 5 — Nurture Sequences | Buttondown, Gmail, Sheets                               |
| All Pipelines                  | Make.com (Pro), Google Sheets, Make.com Data Stores     |

Start with Pipeline 2. It has the fewest dependencies and the fastest path to a working end-to-end test.
